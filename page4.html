   <h1>why am doing bussiness</h1>
   <p>
       if i am asked why am doing this course i would say this:
       its a course that trains you skills of bussiness as well as skills of computing,,
       the coursetrains me as a job creator rather than a job seeker
       the demand of computing skills in this digital world is incredibly rising because most jobs of now adays
       requires computer skills
       and ofcousre computing is fun at some points and enjoyable so those are the few reasons that pushed
       me in to doing this coures that am doing
